Imidiate Goals: 
Digitize and curve fit the remaining curves for Hi/Lo compression and rebound damping...DONE
Implement the dampening curve in lookup tables 
Develop a function to switch between compression and rebound dampening
Develop a function that switches between spring/stroke settings on the fly (if possible)
Validate spring, mass, damper and input forces are summing correctly and there are no issues
Clean the damperLUT script file 
Parametrize the model completely, that runs off of the preloaded script
Implement a spring subsystem for the bump stop to combat compression vibration when at the end of stroke
